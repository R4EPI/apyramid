Description: Provides a quick method for visualizing non-aggregated line-list
    or aggregated census data stratified by age and one or two categorical
    variables (e.g. gender and health status) with any number of values. It
    returns a 'ggplot' object, allowing the user to further customize the
    output. This package is part of the 'R4Epis' project
