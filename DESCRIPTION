Description: The goal of this package is to provide a quick method for
    visualizing un-aggregated line list or aggregated census data stratified by
    age and one or two categorical variables (e.g. gender and health status)
    with any number of values. It returns a 'ggplot' object, allowing the user
    to further customize the output. This package is part of the 'R4Epis' project.
