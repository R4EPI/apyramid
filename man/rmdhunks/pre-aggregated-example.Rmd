Pre-aggregated data
-------------------

{apyramid} can also be used to visualize pre-aggregated data. This example is
the US census data from 2018:

```{r us2018}
us_labels <- labs(
  x = "Age group", 
  y = "Thousands of people", 
  title = "US Cenus Data 2018",
  caption = "source: https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/age-and-sex/2018-age-sex-composition.html"
)

data(us_2018)
us_2018
p <- age_pyramid(us_2018, age_group = age, split_by = gender, count = count)
p + us_labels
```

You can also use another factor to split the data:

```{r us2018_factor}
data(us_ins_2018) # stratified by gender and health insurance status
data(us_gen_2018) # stratified by gender and generational status
p_ins <- age_pyramid(us_ins_2018, age_group = age, split_by = gender, stack_by = insured, count = count)
p_gen <- age_pyramid(us_gen_2018, age_group = age, split_by = gender, stack_by = generation, count = count)
p_ins + us_labels
p_gen + us_labels
```
