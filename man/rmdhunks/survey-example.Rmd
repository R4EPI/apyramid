Survey Data
-----------

Beyond that, survey data can be incorporated with the help of srvyr. Note that
while it will show the weighted counts, it will not show the confidence
intervals as that highly depends on the appropriate choice of CI estimator. This
is meant as more of quick visualization tool for EDA. 

```{r srvyr}
library(srvyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
data(api, package = "survey")

dstrata <- apistrat %>%
  mutate(apicat = cut(api00, pretty(api00), include.lowest = TRUE, right = TRUE)) %>%
  as_survey_design(strata = stype, weights = pw)
 
age_pyramid(dstrata, apicat, split_by = stype)

theme_set(old_theme)
```
